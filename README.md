ðŸš€ MERN Authentication System (Full Stack Project)

Tech Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, JWT, Nodemailer, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query

Developed a secure authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and HTTP-only cookies to manage user sessions and prevent XSS attacks.

Implemented user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities with bcrypt.js for secure password hashing.

Integrated email verification and OTP-based authentication using Nodemailer to send 6-digit verification and reset codes directly to usersâ€™ emails.

Built a React.js frontend with TanStack Query for optimized API state management and Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI design.

Designed RESTful APIs in Express.js and structured a scalable backend architecture with clean controller logic and middleware-based authentication.

Ensured secure cross-origin communication by configuring CORS policies and cookie-based token handling between frontend and backend.

Enhanced user experience with real-time form validation, toast notifications, and OTP expiry timers.

Deployed the complete MERN app with environment-based configurations for production-grade security (HTTPS, SameSite cookies, JWT expiry).

ðŸ’¡ Optional Short Summary (for project description section)

A full-stack MERN authentication system featuring secure JWT-based login, email verification, and password reset with OTP verification. Built using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with responsive Tailwind CSS UI and robust backend APIs.
